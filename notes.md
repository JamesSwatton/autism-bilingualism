#web #autism

[ ] Get original Autism and Bilingualism logo from old laptop and edit to make
the 'and' smaller. Adjust the spacing too, perhaps make it all a little closer
together?

[ ] Unify margins ratios on typography - currently too many different margins
being used.
[ ] Add aria labels across whole site.
[ ] Create smaller logo for mobile version i.e. A&B
[ ] Refactor question-wrapper to so that it's not just for questions and
unopinionated about internal element types. (i.e. use class names as targets
instead of elements)
[ ] Add logos and quick contact info to footer
[?] Try and fix outside link svg sizing/insertion on references and abstracts.
[?] Try adding complimentory background colours to images. Look at Psyche
website for inspiration. 
[?] Make text resize like mailchimp developer site
[?] Create modified version of dude_sit illustration - it should have elements of
language in it; a phone with music or video playing, bird singing? 
[x] Monochrome images with slight noise added to create a tiny bit of texture is
better than current halftone effect. Modify all images to have this style

isn't rendering on resources page. *Questions should be an h3 element to help
with readability*
