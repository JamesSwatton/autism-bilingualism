[ ] Check font sizes for mobile, add size variable and style breakpoints.
[ ] Finalise colour balance between all illustrations.
[ ] Try adding complimentory background colours to images. Look at Psyche website for inspiration.
[ ] Unify margins ratios on typography - currently too many different margins being used.
[ ] Monochrome images with slight noise added to create a tiny bit of texture is better than current halftone effect. Modify all images to have this style.

[ ] Add aria labels across whole site.
[ ] Make text resize like mailchimp developer site

[ ] Refactor question-wrapper to so that it's not just for questions and unopinionated about internal element types. (i.e. use class names as targets instead of elements)
