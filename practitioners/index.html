            <p>Background: At least 25% of autistic children worldwide have the potential to grow up in a
              bilingual environment. However, many autistic children are being denied opportunities to access additional
              languages and the cultural, familial and community connections that come with this. There is little
              evidence
              identifying the barriers to language learning and access, and no research addressing the perspectives of
              speech and language therapists (SLTs), who are crucial in supporting parents to make informed choices
              about
              bilingualism with their child. Aims: The aim of this research was to understand the experiences of SLTs
              working with autistic bilingual children, to understand the main considerations when working with
              families,
              and the opportunities and barriers for training, including the sources of information that current
              practice
              is based on. Methods and Procedures: Twelve SLTs from across the UK were recruited for this study. All
              participants were experienced in working with autistic bilingual children and their families (M=7 years,
              Range 4-23 years). Semi-structured interviews were conducted and focused on the experiences of SLTs
              regarding familial bilingual experiences, the effect of socio-cultural factors of practice, and the extent
              to which practice is based on current research. Outcomes and Results: Data were analysed using reflexive
              thematic analysis. Three central themes were identified from the interviews: (1) participants discussed
              parental uncertainties as to whether they were doing the right thing for their child, (2) while
              participants
              were in support of bilingualism, they were not always confident that they were providing the right advice,
              and found it difficult to in keep up to date with relevant, evidence-based research, (3) participants
              highlighted a need to shift towards a more inclusive and culturally diverse practice. Conclusions and
              implications: This is the first qualitative study to understand the perspectives of SLTs working with
              autistic bilingual children. We identify several key difficulties in supporting access to language
              learning,
              and these findings have immediate and longer-term implications for supporting SLTs, and in turn, the
              children, and families they support.</p>

            <p>Background: Autistic children show reduced attentional preferences to social stimuli early in
              development, and these differences have consequences on a range of social domains. One factor that could
              influence development in those processes is bilingualism. Parents and practitioners frequently voice
              unfounded concerns that bilingualism could cause delays in autistic children, yet there is little evidence
              to dispute this idea. While there are studies focusing on the impact of bilingualism on cognition in
              autistic children, no research has focused on the relationship between bilingualism and social attention.
              Aims: This study therefore investigated the impact of bilingual exposure on social attention in autistic
              (n = 33) and neurotypical children (n = 42) aged 6–13 years. Rather than a monolingual/bilingual
              comparison, participants had varying degrees of bilingual exposure, and exposure was treated as a
              continuous variable. Participants completed an eye-tracking task measuring visual attention to interacting
              versus non-interacting human figures. Results: Bilingual exposure did not affect dwell time to interacting
              or non-interacting figures for the neurotypical or autistic groups. However, there was a three-way
              interaction between diagnosis, figure type and vocabulary scores on dwell time. Conclusions: Higher
              vocabulary scores in neurotypical participants was associated with significantly less dwell time to
              non-interacting stimuli. This is the first study to assess the effects of bilingualism on social
              attention; here, concerns of bilingualism are not upheld.</p>

            <p>Introduction: While research shows no negative effects of bilingualism on autistic children’s
              development, due to misconceptions around both autism and bilingualism, bilingual parents and
              educational/clinical practitioners who advise them often express unfounded concerns that exposing autistic
              children to more than one language will cause confusion and developmental delays. To understand the
              reasons that drive these misconceptions, this study focuses on: identifying factors that impact family
              decisions about (not) raising autistic children bilingually; attitudes toward bilingualism expressed by
              the community, doctors, family members, and teachers; sources of information about bilingualism and autism
              available to families.</p>

            <p>Language proficiency and use are highly heterogeneous between autistic people. While some develop
              language skills within a typical range and timeframe (Brignell et al., 2018), others experience
              significant difficulties (Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg, 2001) and language delay is the most common cause of
              initial referral to specialist services in children (Dover & Le Couteur, 2007). Difficulties with
              pragmatic language, such as metaphor, are often present even for those who are otherwise fluent
              communicators (Paul et al., 2014; Tager-Flusberg et al., 2009). Other challenges include following
              communication norms, such as turn taking during conversation, structuring narratives, and repairing
              communicative breakdown (Geller, 1998; Paul et al., 2014; Surian et al., 1996) – these are not impairments
              per se, but the mismatch between autistic communication and other’s expectations can result in problems.
              At the same time, there is plenty of evidence for enhanced linguistic skills among autistic people,
              including hyperlexia (Craig & Telfer, 2005), and an oft-reported capacity for self-taught acquisition of
              multiple languages (Digard et al., 2020).</p>
