                  <strong>Background:</strong> More than 25% of autistic children
                  worldwide have the potential to hear or speak more than one
                  language. However, autistic children are still frequently denied
                  opportunities to access additional languages and the cultural,
                  familial and community connections that come with this. There is
                  no direct evidence from speech and language therapists (SLTs).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Aims:</strong> The aim of this research was to
                  understand the experiences of SLTs working with autistic
                  bilingual children, focusing on current sources of information
                  that practitioners have, and considerations when working with
                  families.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Methods:</strong> Twelve SLTs from across the UK were
                  recruited for this study. Interviews were conducted and focused
                  on the experiences of SLTs regarding familial bilingual
                  experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Results:</strong> Three themes were identified from the
                  interviews: (1) participants discussed parental uncertainties as
                  to whether they were doing the right thing for their child. (2)
                  While participants were in support of bilingualism, they were
                  not always confident that they were providing the right advice,
                  and found it difficult to keep up to date with relevant,
                  evidence-based research, (3) participants highlighted a need to
                  shift towards a more inclusive and culturally diverse practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> We identified key difficulties in
                  supporting access to language learning, and these findings have
                  immediate and longer-term implications for supporting SLTs, and
                  in turn, the children, and families they support.

                <p>
                  <strong>Background:</strong> Research suggests that autistic
                  children often show differences in attending to social stimuli,
                  and sometimes prefer to attend to different aspects of social
                  information. There are a number of factors that could influence
                  this, one being bilingualism. Parents and practitioners often
                  feel worried that bilingualism could cause delays to social and
                  cognitive development for autistic children, yet there is little
                  evidence to dispute this idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Aims:</strong> This study therefore investigated the
                  impact of bilingual exposure on social attention in autistic
                  children.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Methods:</strong> 33 autistic and 43 neurotypical
                  children aged 6-13 years were recruited. Participants, who had
                  varying degrees of bilingual exposure at home, completed an
                  eye-tracking task that measured attention to pictures of
                  interacting versus non-interacting human figures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Results:</strong> Bilingual exposure did not affect
                  interest in interacting or non-interacting figures in
                  neurotypical children or autistic children, so bilingualism did
                  not directly affect social attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> There is no evidence that
                  bilingualism negatively affects social attentional skills in
                  autistic or non-autistic children. This is important to show
                  that all children should have access to bilingualism with no
                  poor effects on aspects of social development.

                  <strong>Introduction:</strong> There are many misconceptions
                  around both autism and bilingualism - bilingual parents and
                  educational/clinical practitioners often express concerns that
                  exposing autistic children to more than one language will cause
                  confusion and developmental delays (despite a lack of any evidence
                  for this).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Aims:</strong> This study looked to understand the
                  reasons that drive these misconceptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Methods:</strong> Through an online survey, we asked 31
                  UK-based bilingual families with autistic children about: factors
                  that impact family decisions about (not) raising autistic children
                  bilingually; attitudes toward bilingualism expressed by the
                  community, doctors, family members, and teachers, and sources of
                  information about bilingualism and autism available to families.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Results:</strong> The families reported choosing
                  bilingualism for their autistic child primarily so that the child
                  can communicate with family and community members. Attitudes
                  toward bilingualism in their networks were predominantly positive,
                  and only about 1/3 of parents had access to information on
                  bilingualism and autism, mostly found on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> We discuss the need for a change of
                  perspective around autism and bilingualism and ways to start going
                  about this.

                  <strong>Overview:</strong> This short paper provides a brief
                  overview of the most recent research regarding autism and
                  bilingualism. One motivation for this short information piece
                  was to address some of the concerns that people have about how
                  language may develop for autistic people in multilingual
                  environments. In particular, many parents of bilingual, autistic
                  children worry that delays in language acquisition or pragmatic
                  challenges of language use may be exacerbated However, concerns
                  about language development have so far not been supported by the
                  literature. We discuss findings from cognitive research as well
                  as research focusing on the importance of family bonds and
                  access to cultural identities.

                  <strong>Overview:</strong>In this paper, we summarise the
                  existing literature on bilingualism and autism, considering
                  perspectives from the bilingual autistic community, and
                  experimental research. Although bilingualism is a valuable tool
                  that enriches cultural, social and lived experiences for
                  autistic and non-autistic people alike, parents of autistic
                  children remain concerned that bilingualism will cause delays in
                  both cognitive and language development. Evidently, findings
                  from research are not reflected in practice or subsequent
                  advice, and it is essential to identify ways to ensure equal
                  access to additional language learning. We identify barriers to
                  participation for autistic bilingual children in terms of
                  familial, clinical and educational perspectives, propose novel
                  solutions to promote additional language learning and suggest
                  changes to practice that will contribute to an evidence base for
                  families and practitioners.

                  <strong>Background:</strong> At least half the world's
                  population is bilingual or lives in a bilingual environment.
                  However, the experiences of autistic bilingual people are rarely
                  represented or acknowledged. So far, research in this field has
                  concentrated primarily on parent perspectives and on the effects
                  of bilingualism for autistic children's skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Aims:</strong> The study explored the experiences of
                  autistic bilingual adults, focusing on the perceived benefits of
                  bilingualism; the shared experiences of autism, bilingualism,
                  especially regarding identity; and the elements that make
                  language learning easier or more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Methods:</strong> In total, 39 autistic bilingual adults
                  completed an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included
                  quantitative questions about their language use, and questions
                  about their experiences of being autistic and bilingual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Results:</strong> Participants reported that being
                  bilingual had shaped their ability to communicate socially; it
                  had helped them to understand the perspectives of others, and
                  better express themselves. Participants also identified many
                  additional opportunities and benefits of bilingualism in terms
                  of relationships, hobbies, mobility, employment, education, and
                  cultural insight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Being bilingual
                  is a part of autistic bilingual people's identity, and different
                  autistic people need different learning strategies to best learn
                  additional languages.
