            <p>
                <strong>Background:</strong> More than 25% of autistic children
                worldwide have the potential to hear or speak more than one
                language. However, autistic children are still frequently denied
                opportunities to access additional languages and the cultural,
                familial and community connections that come with this. There is
                no direct evidence from speech and language therapists (SLTs).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Aims:</strong> The aim of this research was to
                understand the experiences of SLTs working with autistic
                bilingual children, focusing on current sources of information
                that practitioners have, and considerations when working with
                families.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Methods:</strong> Twelve SLTs from across the UK were
                recruited for this study. Interviews were conducted and focused
                on the experiences of SLTs regarding familial bilingual
                experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Results:</strong> Three themes were identified from the
                interviews: (1) participants discussed parental uncertainties as
                to whether they were doing the right thing for their child. (2)
                While participants were in support of bilingualism, they were
                not always confident that they were providing the right advice,
                and found it difficult to keep up to date with relevant,
                evidence-based research, (3) participants highlighted a need to
                shift towards a more inclusive and culturally diverse practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusions:</strong> We identified key difficulties in
                supporting access to language learning, and these findings have
                immediate and longer-term implications for supporting SLTs, and
                in turn, the children, and families they support.

            <p>
                <strong>Background:</strong> Research suggests that autistic
                children often show differences in attending to social stimuli,
                and sometimes prefer to attend to different aspects of social
                information. There are a number of factors that could influence
                this, one being bilingualism. Parents and practitioners often
                feel worried that bilingualism could cause delays to social and
                cognitive development for autistic children, yet there is little
                evidence to dispute this idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Aims:</strong> This study therefore investigated the
                impact of bilingual exposure on social attention in autistic
                children.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Methods:</strong> 33 autistic and 43 neurotypical
                children aged 6-13 years were recruited. Participants, who had
                varying degrees of bilingual exposure at home, completed an
                eye-tracking task that measured attention to pictures of
                interacting versus non-interacting human figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Results:</strong> Bilingual exposure did not affect
                interest in interacting or non-interacting figures in
                neurotypical children or autistic children, so bilingualism did
                not directly affect social attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusions:</strong> There is no evidence that
                bilingualism negatively affects social attentional skills in
                autistic or non-autistic children. This is important to show
                that all children should have access to bilingualism with no
                poor effects on aspects of social development.

                <strong>Introduction:</strong> There are many misconceptions
                around both autism and bilingualism - bilingual parents and
                educational/clinical practitioners often express concerns that
                exposing autistic children to more than one language will cause
                confusion and developmental delays (despite a lack of any evidence
                for this).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Aims:</strong> This study looked to understand the
                reasons that drive these misconceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Methods:</strong> Through an online survey, we asked 31
                UK-based bilingual families with autistic children about: factors
                that impact family decisions about (not) raising autistic children
                bilingually; attitudes toward bilingualism expressed by the
                community, doctors, family members, and teachers, and sources of
                information about bilingualism and autism available to families.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Results:</strong> The families reported choosing
                bilingualism for their autistic child primarily so that the child
                can communicate with family and community members. Attitudes
                toward bilingualism in their networks were predominantly positive,
                and only about 1/3 of parents had access to information on
                bilingualism and autism, mostly found on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusions:</strong> We discuss the need for a change of
                perspective around autism and bilingualism and ways to start going
                about this.

                <strong>Overview:</strong> This short paper provides a brief
                overview of the most recent research regarding autism and
                bilingualism. One motivation for this short information piece
                was to address some of the concerns that people have about how
                language may develop for autistic people in multilingual
                environments. In particular, many parents of bilingual, autistic
                children worry that delays in language acquisition or pragmatic
                challenges of language use may be exacerbated However, concerns
                about language development have so far not been supported by the
                literature. We discuss findings from cognitive research as well
                as research focusing on the importance of family bonds and
                access to cultural identities.

                <strong>Overview:</strong>In this paper, we summarise the
                existing literature on bilingualism and autism, considering
                perspectives from the bilingual autistic community, and
                experimental research. Although bilingualism is a valuable tool
                that enriches cultural, social and lived experiences for
                autistic and non-autistic people alike, parents of autistic
                children remain concerned that bilingualism will cause delays in
                both cognitive and language development. Evidently, findings
                from research are not reflected in practice or subsequent
                advice, and it is essential to identify ways to ensure equal
                access to additional language learning. We identify barriers to
                participation for autistic bilingual children in terms of
                familial, clinical and educational perspectives, propose novel
                solutions to promote additional language learning and suggest
                changes to practice that will contribute to an evidence base for
                families and practitioners.</p>

                  <strong>Background:</strong> At least half the world's
                  population is bilingual or lives in a bilingual environment.
                  However, the experiences of autistic bilingual people are rarely
                  represented or acknowledged. So far, research in this field has
                  concentrated primarily on parent perspectives and on the effects
                  of bilingualism for autistic children's skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Aims:</strong> The study explored the experiences of
                  autistic bilingual adults, focusing on the perceived benefits of
                  bilingualism; the shared experiences of autism, bilingualism,
                  especially regarding identity; and the elements that make
                  language learning easier or more difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Methods:</strong> In total, 39 autistic bilingual adults
                  completed an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included
                  quantitative questions about their language use, and questions
                  about their experiences of being autistic and bilingual.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Results:</strong> Participants reported that being
                  bilingual had shaped their ability to communicate socially; it
                  had helped them to understand the perspectives of others, and
                  better express themselves. Participants also identified many
                  additional opportunities and benefits of bilingualism in terms
                  of relationships, hobbies, mobility, employment, education, and
                  cultural insight. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Being bilingual
                  is a part of autistic bilingual people's identity, and different
                  autistic people need different learning strategies to best learn
                  additional languages.
