					<p>We are researchers at Queen Margaret University & The University of Edinburgh who work on
						better understanding
						bilingualism for autistic people. We work with autistic people and their families,
						practitioners and educators
						to make sure that our research reaches the people that need it the most.</p>

					<p>We hope that these resources will help parents communicate with their children without being
						worried, and show
						that speaking your preferred language can only bring you closer to your children.</p>
