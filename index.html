				language with your autistic child will be a problem, then this site is for you.</p>

			<h2>Hi Ciao Hola Cześć Hallå</h2>
			<p>We are researchers at Queen Margaret University & The University of Edinburgh who work on better understanding
				bilingualism for autistic people. We work with autistic people and their families, practitioners and educators
				to make sure that our research reaches the people that need it the most.</p>

			<p>We hope that these resources will help parents communicate with their children without being worried, and show
				that speaking your preferred language can only bring you closer to your children.</p>
