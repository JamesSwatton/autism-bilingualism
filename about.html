				<p>We are researchers at Queen Margaret University & The University of Edinburgh who work on better
					understanding bilingualism for autistic people. We work with autistic people and their families, practitioners
					and educators to make sure that our research reaches the people that need it the most.</p>

				<p>We hope that these resources will help parents communicate with their children without being worried, and
					show that speaking your preferred language can only bring you closer to your children.</p>

					<p>I am a developmental psychologist whose research focuses on Neurodivergent lived experiences, bilingualism
						and education.</p>

					<p>Central to my work is a commitment to involving the communities that I work with in the research process;
						ensuring this research has a strong participatory ethos and eal-world relevance to the people that matter.
					</p>

					<p>I’m a lecturer in Psychology & Education at QMU in Edinburgh, and before this, I was a Research fellow at
						the
						SMRC, University of Edinburgh.</p>

					<p>I am part of an advisory board working with the Scottish Government on how to increase understanding of
						autism in the general public across Scotland (<a href="https://differentminds.scot/">Different Minds</a>)
						and
						a member of the <a href="https://embracingcomplexity.org.uk/">Embracing Complexity</a>.

					<p>I am an early career researcher interested in all things to do with autism and neurodiversity.</p>

					<p>After studying Biology and Neurobiology in Lyon (France), I came to Edinburgh to do a PhD researching
						whether
						being bilingual shaped the social life, mind, and brain of autistic and non-autistic people.</p>

					<p>Since then, I have expended my research into other aspects of the autism & bilingualism experience, and I
						am
						also supervising several projects looking at mental health, masking, intersectionality, social cognition,
						and
						access to healthcare for neurodivergent people.</p>

					<p>I am absolutely passionate about community engagement and science communication, so I also always find a
						way
						to get involved in too many outreach and impact-related projects.</p>
