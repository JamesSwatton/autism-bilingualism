            <h3 class="subheading" role="button">What causes autism?</h3>
            <p class="info">Most experts think that there isn't one cause of autism, and sometimes it can be due to
              genetics. Autism
              starts
              before a child is born, even if it takes a few years to be visible. <strong>Autism is NOT caused by bad
                parenting, vaccines, infections, diet or trauma</strong>.</p>

            <p class="info">No, there is no cure, and there is no need for a cure. Any treatment that pretends to be a
              cure is not honest.</p>

              but
              they will always be autistic. Autism is an important part of their identity.</p>

          <p class="subheading">Does growing up with several languages confuse autistic children?</p>
          <p>No, it does not confuse them.</p>
          <p class="subheading">Does bilingualism make learning each language harder?</p>
          <p>No, it does not. Autistic children can have difficulties with language, but they can still learn several
            languages. It might take them a bit longer, but this is common for all bilingual children.</p>
          <p class="subheading">What if my child does not speak?</p>
          <p>No, it does not. Autistic children can have difficulties with language, but they can still learn several
            languages. It might take them a bit longer, but this is common for all bilingual children.</p>
          <p class="subheading">Should I stop speaking my language and use English instead?</p>
          <p>No, speak the language you are most comfortable with. Research shows that this is best for parents and
            children.</p>
          <p class="subheading">Does growing up with two languages make it harder for my child to learn and understand
            things? </p>
          <p>No, growing up with several languages is not bad for your child’s thinking and learning skills.</p>
          <p class="subheading">Are there good things about growing up with several languages for my autistic child?</p>
          <p>Yes, many good things! Your language will help your child connect with their family and community. It is
            also
            very good for their future life. Knowing several languages helps understand people, access fun activities,
            and
            get jobs.</p>
